# surgical-mask-detection

## this is a naive surgical-mask-detection system developed as a quick start into deep learning...

### [surgical_mask_detection.ipynb](https://github.com/YongLS/surgical-mask-detection/blob/main/surgical-mask-detection.ipynb) illustrates a naive model built achieving unsatisfactory outcome.
### more realistic model should be considered --> transfer learning approaches ~ feature extraction / fine tuning for applicability etc...

# surgical-mask-detection

## this is a naive surgical-mask-detection system developed as a quick start into deep learning...

### [surgical_mask_detection.ipynb](https://github.com/YongLS/surgical-mask-detection/blob/main/surgical-mask-detection.ipynb) illustrates a naive model built achieving unsatisfactory outcome.
### more realistic model should be considered --> transfer learning approaches ~ feature extraction / fine tuning for applicability etc...
### this work as an effort to quick dive into the computer vision & deep learning world... the model is built using Keras API on TensorFlow
### model is trained in [Colab...](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?utm_source=scs-index)
